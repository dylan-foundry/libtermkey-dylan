This library wraps `libtickit`_.

To do a build, use ``make`` so that the appropriate steps
are executed.

This assumes that you've already got `libtickit`_ installed
and on the default search path. To install `libtickit`_, you
will also need to have `libtermkey`_ installed as well.

You will need Open Dylan 2014.1 or later.

You will also need a build of ``melange`` from the
`melange`_ repo on your ``$PATH``.
